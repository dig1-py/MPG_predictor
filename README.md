# MPG_predictor
End-to-end ML model for predicting automobile fuel efficiency (MPG) using CatBoost and Streamlit.
It predicts automobile miles per gallon(mileage) for cars when given inputs like displacement, horsepower, number of cylinders etc.
Tech Stack includes Catboost, pandas, scikit-learn. 
Catboost handles categorical values and regression; pandas for data frame cleaning, manipulation and feature engineering; scikit-learn for its easy to use train_test_split function and metrics and streamlit for UI and deployment
