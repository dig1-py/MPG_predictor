# MPG_predictor
End-to-end ML model for predicting automobile fuel efficiency (MPG) using CatBoost and Streamlit.
It predicts automobile miles per gallon(mileage) for cars when given inputs like displacement, horsepower, number of cylinders etc.
I have used catboost because of its ability to handle categorical values effectively while also achieving low error on train and test sets.
